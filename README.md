Easy game - roll the dice and hold your score. But be careful! If you roll a 1, you lose your points for that turn, and it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.

The game has been prepared based on the lessons from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
